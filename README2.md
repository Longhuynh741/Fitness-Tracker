<hr>

This project was created for the intents and purposes of requiring you to create a Mongo database with a mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. You accomplish this from creating a fitness tracker app. The tracker will be allow you to create your own workouts, edit them, and save them.  Execution of this requires that we: <ul>
<li> Utilize npm packages to fully utilize mongoose database
<li> Being able to correctly deploy to heroku
<li> Troubleshooting errors along the way
</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)  with aide from [NPM documentations](https://www.npmjs.com/).
